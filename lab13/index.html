				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create an interactive game called "FizzBuzzBoom" with the purpose of teaching us how to use loops!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't have too many issues with this lab! We worked on it together with two of our friends so we were able to collaborate and help one another with This
					   lab. Our only problems we had was forgetting to include specific parts of the code into Javascript. We kept adding inoccrect formatting, like putting parenthesis where
					   curly brackets were supposed to be. We also forgot to put the error function in our code, but found out our mistake and added it. 

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty well! It was cool to play around with the fizzbuzzboom game, even though the concept confused at times. It was a good way to practice loops, even
					   if they are a tad long and slightly exessive. It is cool to see it work though!
					   our mistakes.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Our results are below! Put in a max number and list 4 factors below. Associate each number factor with either "Fizz", 
					   "Buzz", or "Boom" </p>
