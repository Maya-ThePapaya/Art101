					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with functions and take user input while also
					manipulating strings!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a few problems with this lab, specifically with the website format. We coded our 
						javascript function correctly and was able to transfer it successfully to our website. Where
						we got stuck was the formatting of the text, and then the image that we wanted to include.
						We were trying to create a padding around our script output, but could not figure it out. We finally 
						got it by figuring out that it could be adjusted through the content section of the CSS and we 
						had to specify that we wanted bottom padding. Our next issue was with our image. We wanted to make
						our image in the center, but it was simply not working. We consulted Wesbot and even called a friend, 
						but we were stuck. We got it at last by asking Wesbot "how do you center a gif in html" and we got our
						solution. Yipee!!
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>TThis lab went pretty well, besides from the fact that the formatting of it took longer than expected.
						The actual javascript part of it was somewhat simple due to us having practice in class, but for some
						reason we just couldn't get our website to look how we wanted to. After a LOT of trial and error, 
						we got our website looking exactly how we envisioned it. We were very proud of how we worked through our
						struggles to make our website the best that it could be!</p>
