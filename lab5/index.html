<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
<div class="minor-section">
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiement with basic javascript
data types and variables to create a list of characteristics about our 
primary method of transportation, being in this case, a red Toyota Yaris.

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>We didn't have too many problems with this lab due to us having experience
with working this type of code in class, but we did run into a few issues.
Our first issue was calculating the math between the car year and the current
    year. We added quotations which messed up our output, but then re read the instructions
    and corrected our error. Another problem we bumped into was how to put our javascript
    code into our html lab. We tested out a few inputs, and with the help of wesbot we 
    were able to successfully put our javascript into our html lab. </p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This lab was pretty successful for us. We were able to accurately code our car information
   into javascript and then transport that to html. Our website looks like the example, with our
   own personal touch of course. Since we had previous practice with certain parts of this lab we were able
   to complete parts of it very quickly. We struggled a bit while putting our javascript code into html,
   but were able to eventually figure it out. We used Wesbot to help us format our code correctly and create
   an effiecent and accurate lab 5 website. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This is our lab 5 index.html that we created to display our javascript code. Enjoy!</p>
