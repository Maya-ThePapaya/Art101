Using the lab reference and a bit of help from a friend, we made a cool gradient border. We got our buttons up and running, but also had problems making our buttons look neat on our page. Using ChatGPT we found how to customize what our buttons look like. Lastly, we had a problem uploading a background image, but our friend Jacky helped us out!');
