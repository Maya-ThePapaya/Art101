						<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">

			

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with functions and callbacks in the console to make a 
						sucessfull calback using arrays!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a few problems with this lab. At first everything with our console went smoothly and we had a working callback, 
						but once we went to put our javascrit into VS code we had a bit of trouble formatting it correctly. THEN we realized that 
						our callback was not giving us the correct answeres! We were trying to get it to determine weather a number was odd or not 
						amd it was not giving us the correct answeres. With the use of google we eventually figured out how to get our funtion and 
						callback to work! The last problem we had was also related to transfering the javascript from the console to vs code again.
						It turns out we just had a few typos that were easily fixed!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was slightly rocky for us, The actual javascript part of it went smootly because we practiced a similar function and callback in class.
						But then we had the whole thing were our callback wasn't working and then our confusion with the formatting of the javascript in VS code.
						Luckily we had little problem with the rest. We worked together to solve the problems that did arize and we are proud of our final result!
