			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>


			<div class="minor-section">


				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>he challenge of this lab was to go back through our previous labs and use our debugging knowledge to
					revise them!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We didn't have too many issues with this lab! One of our main issues was honeslty finding issues to
					correct within our previous labs!
					We didn't have any labs that didn't work correctly, so most of our corrections were with formatting
					to make our code or output clearer and
					more pleasing to look at. We went through each lab to see what we could fix or improve, and ended up
					improving a few of our labs!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> This lab was pretty interesting. It was cool to look back on some of our old labs because some of
					them were kinda...ugly. It was cool to go back
					into them and see how we can use our knowledge to improve the overall looks of our labs!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Below we have screenshots of the labs that we fixed, and how we fixed them!</p>


				<img src="img/1.png" width=400>
				<p>This is Harlow`s original HTML website and she added a snazzy border around her bio and their photo
					to make it look snazzier!</p>


				<img src="img/2.png" width=400>
				<p>This is lab 4 (pseudocoding lab) and we went in and edited our commas in our pseudocode from ‘ to `
					since it
					says that this is the correct way to format the code. We also changed the pseudocode titles so that
					they are
					the same size as the litter box one used to be smaller.
				</p>

				<img src="img/3.png" width=400>
				<p> This is lab 5 and we went in and made our output bigger and more eye-catching so that people can
					read it next to the car.
					It used to be just regular text, but we stylized it using CSS and gave it a cool border by using a
					container.
				</p>

				<img src="img/4.png" width=400>
				<img src="img/7.png" width=400>
				<p> This is our before and after of lab 6. We noticed that in our original lab 6 our output for the
					kinds of transportation we use
					seemed cramped and there was no spaces between our modes of transport. To fix this, we went into our
					Javascript and added forEach
					to iterate over myTransport and output each item in a list ( li element). We also wrapped the
					transport items in a ul for better
					structure and readability. We cant actually put the exact edits we made because it codes them into
					our text LOL!
				</p>

				<img src="img/5.png" width=400>
				<img src="img/6.png" width=400>
				<p> This is our lab 7 javascript. We had an error in which our website prompt appeared twice on the
					webpage instead of just once. We fixed
					our error by removing one of the javascript links that we had on our HTML. We didn`t realize that we
					had the script type at the top, and
					the script on the bottom, which resulted in our prompt occurring twice.

				</p>

				<img src="img/8.png" width=400>
				<p>This is our lab 10 javascript, in which we accidentally put make “onvo” instead of make “convo” which
					made our output come out incorrectly.
					We fixed our spelling error to correct our output.
				</p>
