					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges of this lab were fiuring out how to link our code to our website,
					   to create changes. We also had to learn how to work and code together as a team 
					   on this project. Learning nre software, such as VS code, HTML, amd CSS were difficult,
					   but proved to be very rewarding!
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We first had to figure out how to get our InstallFest repository working in VS code. After
						we figured that out, we struggled to make our changes in the code appear on our website. While using CSS 
						we had to trouble-shoot a lot of commands in order to the outcomes we wanted. We also had a problem 
						uploading our image, but we were able to use Wesbot to figure it our. Wesbot it our Westie, which is short for Wes Bestie
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment has been successful. We have learned how to change the appearence and content of our website. 
						We put a lot of energy into this assignment because this is all new to us, but we were able to work together to figure it out.
					    we did additional reasearch to customize multiple aespects of our website, like the image we added and the 
					    background color.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We are very pleased with our website. It is functional, Informative, and aesthetically pleasing to look at.</p>
