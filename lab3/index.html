					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this Lab I found the process of linking everything a bit confusing.
					   I also found adding images and sizeing them to be a bit dificult.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I couldnt figure out how to link the other pages to my home page
					   but working with other pepole was really helpfull and they helped me figure it out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this project went a lot more smothly than the last one because 
					   I have a pretty good understanding of what to do interms of html and css now. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are all my screenshots and my file structure!</p>
