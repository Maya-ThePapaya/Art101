					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this Lab I found the process of linking everything to my homepage website a bit confusing,
						but working with my partner to trouble-shoot was very helpfull and we eventually got it!
					    I also found adding images and sizeing them to be a bit dificult even though we did it last time,
						again Wesbot was used to help us with formatting. We are still Westies aka Wes Besties.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first linking all my labs to my home page was provignt to be difficult, I thoght 
						my code was all formated correctly, it wasnt red or anything! It still didnt work though, 
						so I had my coding buddy take a loook and turns out I had put herf instead of href!!! 
						I just speled it wrong.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this project went a lot more smothly than the last one because Harlow and I worked 
						together on the last lab and figured out the basics of HTML and CSS as we went. I think that 
						I have a pretty good understanding of the basics of both languages now! </p>
