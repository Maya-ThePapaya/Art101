				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>he challenge of this lab was to go back through our previous labs and use our debugging knowledge to
					revise them!
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We didn't have too many issues with this lab! One of our main issues was honeslty finding issues to
					correct within our previous labs!
					We didn't have any labs that didn't work correctly, so most of our corrections were with formatting
					to make our code or output clearer and
					more pleasing to look at. We went through each lab to see what we could fix or improve, and ended up
					improving a few of our labs!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> This lab was pretty interesting. It was cool to look back on some of our old labs because some of
					them were kinda...ugly. It was cool to go back
					into them and see how we can use our knowledge to improve the overall looks of our labs!
