			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with Javascipt arrays and objects
					   by declaring an array for our modes of transportation and an object for our main ride.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not bump into too many labs while doing this project. One issue that we had 
					   was how to state the age of the car by using the current year subtracted from the year of 
					   the car. We tried to follow the example but used ChatGPT to create a formatted code to calculate
					   the age of the car and we were successful. We also had a bit of trouble when linking our javascript
					   code to our html, but with a bit of trial and error were able to figure it out.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty well. We had to work remotely due to us being under the weather, but we were able to 
						still collaborate on our final product together. We spent a good amount of time making sure all of our 
						Javascript code was accurate and worked out any bugs that we had in our code. Overall, we both learned a 
						lot through experiementing with arrays and objects and liked displaying our knowledge on our html site! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Our results are below! We have both our Javascript codes displayed here on this html website. This is the program execution:</p>
