//Set rules of the game: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper
//Get player input by prompting player to pick rock, paper, or scissors
//Read player's input of rock, paper, or scissors
//Generate a random number to represent the computer’s choice (1=rock, 2=paper, 3=scissors)
//Convert random number into corresponding choice
//Compare player’s choice with computer’s choice to determine winner
//Implement game logic to determine outcome: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper, if the same they tie
//Display result of the game (you win, you lose, you tie)
//Ask if they want to play again and repeat step 2-8 if they say yes
